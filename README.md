# Introduction
Hello my name is Emma Russell, I'm 20 and currently an IS Apprentice at Durham Univeristy. This is just a quick test site I have made ot practice using Markdown language. 

# What is Python
Python is a high level programming language useful for a multitude of different purposes and projects due to it's flexibility and compatibility with a range of libraries.

On this page I will go over some basics about Python that may be useful to know for beginners, such as:
- A brief introduction to Python as a language
- Some basic libaries for you to use


# What does Python look like?
Python is a high-level language, this means that it is closer to English than it is to machine code. Similar to any other programming language it has built-in functions which can be used to perform an array of actions such as creating variables, printing text, performing calculations and recieving inputs from a user. Python uses colour coding to highlight important aspects of the page such as recognised functions and syntax errors.

Below is an example of some Python code- don't get too caught up on trying to read it; just take a look at the layout and colour coding as aforementioned.

Before we try and use any code we should go over some basic functions, please use the table below as a quick guide:

|Function|What it does|
|--------|------------|
|print("Text")|Outputs a string, in this case "Text"|
|input("?")|Outputs a string requiring a response from the user, in this case the output is "?"|
|VariableName = 'Data'|This can be used to set a variable- in this case the variable name is "VariableName" and the data stored in this variable is just "Data"|

Below is an example of some code using these functions:

>print("Hello!") <br>
>Name = input("What is your name?") <br>
>print("Nice to meet you ", Name)

This will output:
>Hello!

Then once the user inputs their name (for this example it is "Simon") it will output:
>Nice to meet you Simon

# So what are Python libraries?
Python libraries are collections of pre-written code that can be used to perform various tasks, making programming simpler and more efficient. These libraries contain modules and packages that provide reusable functions and classes for specific functionalities, such as data analysis, machine learning, web development, and more

**Some examples of Libraries include:**
- NumPy
- Pandas
- SciPy
